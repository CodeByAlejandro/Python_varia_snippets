# Python_varia_snippets
Various code snippets written in Python to test things or to save useful code that is not a full project

Python modules:
- `decorator_with_type_hinting.py`: Showcases a working typehinting setup for decorators
- `fib_generator_with_perf_timing.py`: Implemented fibonacci generator and compared timings between different implementations with a performance decorator (mostly interesting is the generator vs list implementation performance)
- `generator_sending.py`: Showcases sending input to yield statements in generators (= 2 directional generators = input & output yielding) + full generator type hinting example
